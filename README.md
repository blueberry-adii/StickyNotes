# 📝 Sticky Notes App (Svelte)

A minimalist sticky notes app built with **Svelte**, a JavaScript Framework.  
Create, drag, edit, and delete sticky notes anywhere on the screen — like your own personal canvas of thoughts!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Create notes anywhere on the screen with a click
- 🎨 Each note has a random background color (good contrast with white text)
- 🖊️ Click on Edit icon to edit any note
- 🚮 Delete note by clicking on the Trash icon
- 🧲 Drag notes to reposition them
- 💾 Notes saved in `localStorage` (they persist when you Log In with your same UserName)
- 🧠 Smart click detection to prevent creating notes over UI elements

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Svelte** — frontend JS framework
- **JavaScript** — logic & state management
- **HTML/CSS** — layout and styles
- **LocalStorage** — for saving notes
